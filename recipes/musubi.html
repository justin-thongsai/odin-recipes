        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Hawaiian snack that is enjoyed throughout the entire state no matter what island you are on. It is an extremely convenient snack that can even be found at 7-Evelen's and enjoyed by locals. It is originally based on the Japanese dish rice balls or onigiri. However it looks much more like sushi than your traditional rice ball.</p>
        <p>This dish is really simple and easy to make and only requires 4 ingredients that are all easily obtainable at your local supermarket. However, a musubi mold helps immensely for the final steps. If you do not have a musubi mold, you can make one yourself with the can that your spam came in.</p>

            <li>Grill the Spam on a pan at medium heat for about 5-7 minutes cooking both sides.</li>
            <li>After your Spam is cooked, cut the nori sheets into halves and place them under your musubi mold.</li>
            <li>Take your cooked rice and place some into the mold until it is about 1cm tall when flattened.</li>
            <li>Remove your mold and place the sliced Spam on top of the rice.</li>
            <li>Wrap the nori around the rice and Spam. Your musubi is now finished, enjoy!</li>
