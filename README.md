# odin-recipes
I will be creating a website for recipes. Right now my web development experience is almost zero. The website will be very basic HTML with just text for the recipes. 

I plan on revisiting the website to clean it up with CSS and making it more visually pleasing than just text. Eventually the goal however is to use Javascript to make the website more interactive.
